`ImportError` is an error message emitted by Python when it failed to load certain
module as requested by programmer. It's a very common error when someone new to
the language trying it out. This website on the same theme, will try provide help
for newcomers on any technologies to overcome their first hurdle.

For beginning, the content here will be related mostly to Python but I'll try to
expand it to other tools and technology as well.

Building content tailored for beginners always tricky and the task is much harder
for those that already spent much time on the topic. The gap between the state of
don't know anything and knowing is wide, making things that been taken for granted,
is a big deal to newcomers. Take for example the [Django Documentation][1], it has
been regarded as one of the best technical documentation but when we got one of our
new hire, it surprising to us that he failed to find the stuff he want through
material. We are not talking about junior developer but experienced person that
has been through various development projects prior to joining us.

Lot's of effort has been spent on this by people much better than me but still I feel
a vacuum when it come to 101 type of lesson material.
