This is the first mini PyCon held in Malaysia so congratulation to the [team][1] that
finally make it happened. It just 1 day event filled with tracks on various topic
related to python. Due to the space limitation, all sessions being held serially in
a single room. Having attend a number of PyCon APAC last time in SG, I'm quite happy
that I managed to follow all the sessions in this mini pycon. It quite frustrating when
you have to decide between two interesting sessions because it run in parallel in two
different places. Below are some quick notes from the sessions that I managed to recall.

* Sphinx and Read The Docs - Eric Holscher
    - Defacto documentation tools in Python Community

* Python on Google App Engine - Desmond Lua
    - Quite an interesting talk.
    - Everything you did probably would cost money so you have to give extra
      attention on how you write your app.

* Boosting Productivity with IPython - Boey Pak Cheong
    - Finally, I had a visual on what Ipython Notebook really is. In fact, in the
      later talk, the presenter was using IPython Notebook to show and demonstrate
      his python code snippet.

* Python Powered Cloud - Joseph Ziegler
    - This imo the most interesting talk.
    - I have long heard about Beanstalkd but never had a chance to give it a try.
    - Beanstalkd probably what I have been looking on how to deploy our apps.
    - The only downside of Beanstalkd is that it based on RHEL which mean for
      organization that been using Ubuntu, it will be a huge leap to migrate.
